Ever since I got into photography Every time you see a person using a cellphone as a main camera you feel… idk, like replaced? A dedicated camera will always be better in nearly every way.

This really only works for people who are too lazy to edit anything or put any dedicated time into a photo or are one of those social media addicts who “need” to post quiet often and consistently. This reduces interest and production in entry level cameras these days. This leads to everyone thinking that photography is super easy and hence people value it less. On a Dedicated camera you need to worry about so many things like shutter speed, aperture, iso, lighting, composition, etc. On a phone it’s just. Snap! Done.

Some clever function like the one to keep the face of a moving person sharp, by shooting another low-shutter image and merging those, is great and I don't see any problem with it - it tries to minimize the technical limitations to give you the intended output. But I don't want a stock image of the moon mapped to my photo of it, that just feels wrong and while maybe the output I strive to achieve, it's fake and just not what I'm actually shooting. Might as well take a reasonable image from Google and claim it's mine.\nI also don't like the over-processing of some phones, or rather, some situations by phones. Some HDR photos look lifeless and flat because there is barely any dynamic anymore, or saturation being overblown and photos of vegetation looking artificial. And lastly, over-sharpening causing halos and/or aliasing - that seems to be a general problem with phones nowadays, removing a lot of detail by noise reduction and then slapping (too much) sharpening on top of that. It's one of the few complaints I have regarding the camera of my Pixel 4a; and yes, I use that phone that does a lot of processing, but at the same time it keeps things fairly natural and I'm satisfied most of the time or even impressed with the photos it can take.\nActually, the sharpening seems to be a general problem nowadays, or at least my personal issue disliking it, following me from smartphone cameras to movies (on physical media at least) and even (video) games - make it blurry and then sharpen it, no one will notice that all the fine detail is gone apparently.. :/", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "@dennisjungbauer4467", "channel": "UCBrU6m63tBv75xx70VCl11Q", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AOPolaSFgwqqEyqyFvi7JJwfAlxJ62GUC7gXwqLz5B3D7g=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": false, "time_parsed": 1658612725.849866}

Since it gave the most real world physical state of lights, colour, skin tone, and even the detail of the photo is sharper than current iPhones' blurry images. The computational photography nowadays doesn't give accurate colour and lights, you would find it heavily adjusted, especially in the situation when the subject looks dark in the sunlight. I think the meaning of computational photography is to breakthrough the physical limitation of lens, so users wouldn't have to adjust the result. But if you're a more serious Instagramer, you see they'd still have to adjust the picture. So, computational photography is still a little early, when smartphone lenses can still breakthrough.

{"cid": "UgwSotC_atDY2wsFK1h4AaABAg", "text": "Great video. But I will quibble with one comment. All photos are a departure from reality. They compress a 3D space onto a 2D space, for one thing. They selectively capture light and color (as do our eyes). Ansel Adams, when asked why he never shot color (which he did for commercial work - unsigned), said that the reason he always shot black and white is because he wanted his photos to be viewed as artistic abstractions of reality and that there be no confusion of reality with his photography. He felt that even going to color would invite such comparisons. The problem, which you rightly identify, is when cameras impose their vision of reality instead of letting the photographer impose his or hers. Of course, that requires a level of technical expertise but, more importantly, the creative vision to express a photographic reality on the part of the photographer. And, you’re right, most people don’t want to do that. But, that’s what continues to set apart those who do (serious photographers) from those who don’t. Of course, George Eastman recognized that over 100 years ago when he built the first consumer camera.

Smartphone cameras have given the masses the ability to get incredibly polished pictures that satisfy that basic want to an incredible degree, and I'm more than happy to let the camera do that work for me so that I can just quickly take a shot that presents itself and have that memory available to share and remember without needing to fuss over it in an editor later on.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "@ClanOMoraign", "channel": "UCvU_DHbh2-V5tfQjvpxjCSg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AOPolaSTXO6mHsFkvrVQ8fXvc1bxHbIqyz53CTknDKIk=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": false, "time_parsed": 1658612753.722551}

(My guess about understanding reality is that we are probably trying to understand something humans aren't capable of understanding, with a tool (consciousness/our brain) we don't even fully understand))\n\nSo to me, the more pertinent question is, how do you share/communicate a memory, or an idea, in an accepted way? \nThe moon scenario is interesting to me in this regard. We share images we feel we have found/created (ex: discovering and sharing memes) to people who already have access (can see) the same content. More abstractly, a phrase like \"I love you\" is copied/pasted all the time, but it can mean many things depending on the context. So I wonder if this baked-in moon controversy boils down to what the sharer and sharee have agreed upon, and/or accepted on how to communicate.\n \nAs a side question, I wonder where people stand on other mediums. Each have their own variables affecting what is/isn't captured/recorded, and the interpretation of it (human perception (senses + thinking)).

In the more pro world, pictures always were about the vision of the photographer and way more art but I think the smart phone users is thinking more like their Polaroid of the past which was usually very documentary. We also currently often treat cellphone photos and now more videos as evidence and proof of an event. Of course, this is changing because we know you can modify stuff, but as pointed out here, right now it generally requires knowledge that you are actually modifying the image or video. \n\nI'm afraid these AI tools kind of make our images more like our memories as they are trying to show what we experienced vs  perhaps what we actually saw, and while that is better in some situations, also leads us to something like false memories or mistaken memories in the digital realm where we used to have a more fixed record. Maybe for court cases we'll go back to requiring Polaroid film to meet evidence standards IDK. Maybe we'll insist on all evidence to be from certified \"dumb, non AI\" imaging which leaves out cell phones. \n\nAnd in daily life IDK how various people will take it. I already treat a professional portrait from someone differently than a candid shot, and as our lives get ever more polished for social media consumption, I think we might cause more depression or feelings of not being as good as everyones not only curated but AI retouched and improved digital lives.

Some way to say \"that rando/news/gov/etc. edited the image/video that they're now showing as fact\". You can think blockchain, but these are devices that aren't (and shouldn't be required) to be connected to the internet to function. What can be done? Will it be like court cameras where they are certified to not edit the image? (note: court cameras are specifically designed to not make shutter noises and only 1 or so brands are allowed to be used... but they're expensive even by DSLR standards). We already have debates about news, social media, and official statements. Humanity uses visuals and sound to convey the world we understand to others... and text, speech, sound, and increasingly video and pictures are not the fact they are believed to be. But instead of \"well, I this is how I remember it\" of cave paintings to stories and performances, it's closer to a Soviet-style propaganda piece, manipulated to elicit an opinion or thought. But instead of manipulating multi-national decisions, it's to get a like on a Twitter post.

{"cid": "UgxFvx9KKJA4KvbpYBt4AaABAg", "text": "This was interesting to see.\nI had a similar fight between reality and AI-processing in February when I had to decide between an iPhone 11 Pro Max and a XS Max because I needed a successor to my 8+. In theory, the 11 was quite hyped back when it came out, but there were many occasions for me where the photos didn’t just look realistic. Colour representation in indoor shots was awful, Text was sharpened like crazy that it looked like everything but what I had before my eyes. I went with the XS then as it was more realistic,  but ever since I have noticed that it f*cks up white balance in some situations and in filming videos colours tend to change because of the integrated algorithm. Since then, I started to use a third party app and now I get pretty good balanced photos under any circumstances; having compared it myself to a 12 Pro Max lately, differences in most settings (cloudy sky, not much light) were not big, but the 12 was much better at white balance on the whole, colours were quite on spot.\n\nGetting back to the main point: I think there are some Computational features that really help to create a good image for the average user. Let‘s say the iPhone‘s HDR when having bright light sources in your picture to not have a blown out spot in the photo. Or proper video stabilization without having to edit it after. But a picture is mainly the reproduction of time and space, i.e. a reproduction of something someone discovered somewhere at a given time. Cameras should reproduce this as accurately as possible, everything else can be done afterwards, be it a simple filter, be it dedicated editing or whatever.

As such, I would be okay with an optimization using data taken within lets say 10 seconds of the moment of capture: you're still fixating the memory of that time, but such that it can represent it better than just one shot. Anything beyond that no longer represents that moment in time imo, and thus should not be accepted (e.g. removing people from backrgrounds or using a pretaken one)\nHOWEVER, if your goal is something different, like a shot for a commercial, then sure anything is allowed, as you are creating a fictional situation anyway. \n\nSo Im predicting different objective capturing  modes.\n\nJust my two cents.

{"cid": "UgxbdVVhnhfq0n7YZCt4AaABAg", "text": "This is something I've always thought about unconsciously.. It's the very basic concept between the experience of photography with a camera & in parallel the experience of editing with advanced tools mixed with a few 'cheap' tricks.\nExample: You take a photo of your early walk through a park filled with trees, fallen leaves, and the occasional person sitting, reading. In the frame is everything I just described but a random bird just pooped a few feet ahead of you lol. The poop is obvious. Yet it's a part of the natural environment so how do you approach it? You can leave it. You can modify it by a) crop the photo b) mask the area* c) cover the 'area' with a mask however it's only going to use the texture surrounding it. It cannot regenerate something from a pre-existing asset. **.\n\nBy pre-existing asset, it's like the example shown of the moon on the phone in the video. It's not using a piece of information from the surface of the moon, rather aligning the shape & projecting it the same way many puppy/cat ears track your face with a filter. Except, on the environment.\nI got lost in the tangent but if you've made it this far - you're beautiful/awesome. In the example I tried to bring up its that you can have a blend of both the organic elements of a photo & the enhancement with AI where the slider on that AI can only work within what's in the photo & not use another/outside source of information to replace something entirely.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "@Demorthus", "channel": "UCa4sIxnCWCCw4uw51G1C5YA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AOPolaTZsphXFjsiU0J7hzT8A6U1V7_irFJLQbs1uhX6=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": false, "time_parsed": 1658612758.360559}

You don't want a photograph of you in a suit at a wedding for documenting a realistic perception of the world, you want a photograph of you, because you expect to look good and of course want that to last. Also, you don't experience an unfiltered reality, and you especially don't remember it that way.

{"cid": "UgwaAabNW3WC8tFmUvN4AaABAg", "text": "Okay so my take is this:\n- Features like the Pixel ones where you can choose a good photo out of 10, are genuinely useful. Try to photograph a kid without it. The great thing about it is, you have all the dials. It doesn't lie to you or hide the details. It's just like, here, this might help, also you can use it as a short video, or not use it at all.\n- Features where it changes the colors or the saturation or overlays a pre-existing image over the real one are downright creepy IMO. I want my photos to reflect the reality. Maybe allow me to do what you're offering IF i want to but most importantly allow me to disable, or better yet, don't enable it by default.\n\nI guess it's more about whether the objective of the feature is assisting you in selection and taking accurately exposed and stable pictures, or lying to you so you get a more \"pleasing\" reality with no possibility of turning it off.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "@boudayoub", "channel": "UCs4vjCueqb1mQLgGVB3Ghkw", "votes": "392", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AOPolaTrYNWwFtHfw6u9xLEruBdnsGoLErqD8HiG__np=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": false, "time_parsed": 1658612762.110737}

{"cid": "UgxBxyr2twUqcGf40Zd4AaABAg", "text": "So prior to owning a Pixel, my standard for a camera on a phone was pretty darn low.  Now I'm not a photograhy buff.  So my thought was always, as long as it's seems fairly accurate that's good enough.  To me other aspects of the phone were much more important.  After owning the original and more so after owning the Pixel 3 that changed.  I just felt like those pictures were always just better, I didn't even understand why at first.  Soon after getting my Pixel 3 this is several years ago I'm with a friend who is a photography buff and an iPhone owner and of course do to the Pixel camera hype he wanted to check it out.  Of course he was immediately impressed but he also kinda pointed out exctly what was happening.  He's basically told me \"Thing is these photos look like the've already been edited.\"  And he kinda pointed out that's why the Pixel seemed to have the  \"better\" camera, it's not necessarily the most realistic like a RAW  photo file, but it was making really good choices to enhance the photo.  He was pretty impressed at the time.  Obviously now a few years later other companies seem to be catching up.  I will say this, I have a Pixel 6 on order, and I've kinda been disappointed with the current Samsung S21 I have because of it's camera which I feel needs multiple shots to get a \"good\" shot or many times I have to run through the built in photo editor or Snapseed.  But it's odd because prior to owning a Pixel that wasn't so important to me.  But yes the smarter camera is probably the better camera for average consumer.  Although it does beg the question how smart is too smart?!?

{"cid": "UgwvpwAe8oDgakEGNnd4AaABAg", "text": "Letting the public vote on which photos look better will have a huge bias. Like you said, every manufacturer has their own idea of what a picture should look like, and users will start to get used to that. Since most people have iphones and therefore get used to seeing their iphone photos as the standard, they will be more biased (on average) to choose the iphone photos when asked which one is better. \n\nThis actually goes a lot further than just pictures with no personal editing. HDR has been overused for so long and passed off as good editing to the general public that people are starting to truly believe that way too much HDR actually looks like a higher quality photo. Smartphone manufacturers and social media apps are skewing the public opinion on what looks good and now people are much more likely to say that terribly over-edited photos are actually high quality. \n\nI can't tell you how many \"professional photographers\" who get paid a lot of money to do photoshoots use auto mode on their DSLR and put the same filter on all of their photos in post regardless on the type of setting, theme, or type of photo. And they get praised for it! The photos themselves aren't even that good in the first place.

Or if you need less security maybe something like what they did on the consoles with digitally signed firmware (trusted computing). You can embedded the private keys inside the processor, so without extreme expensive lab equipment you has no chance to extract it and let the processor to validate all components serial number which the factory programmed after assembly. But if there is some software bug, the whole process can be jeopardized. (jailbreaking) Not speaking about that if somebody can manufacture a custom sensor (if they can circumvent the serial checking) to fake the physical image, or put a fake screen in front of the camera that can fool the sensor, etc. I think with unsupervised physical access and adequate resources, you can't trust the hardware 100%.

{"cid": "Ugx-Op-lCs4Rf1OUTu14AaABAg", "text": "My take is this: The way I use my smartphone camera and the way I use an \"actual\" camera will always be very different.\n\n When I take a shot with my \"actual\" camera I'm thinking about light, aperture, exposure, composition, focus, and countless other little factors that I want control over. If I'm shooting on film there's even more careful thought and planning, I'm spending at l very least 2-3 minutes setting up a shot. What I am trying to end up with is not an accurate representation of the scene, but rather an artistic vision of it. When I get the images on my computer, I don't go straight to posting -- I spend time deciding on colors, removing distracting objects or people, finding the right crop. The image  is a production that takes hours. It is less about the scene depicted and more about the piece of art as a whole.\n \nIn contrast, when I take a picture with my phone I want to quickly capture a fleeting moment in time. Maybe my cats did something funny, maybe I'm proud of a meal I just cooked, maybe I want to record a good day out with friends. The goal is not to make lengthy artistic decisions and end up with something I'd be happy to hang on my wall, it's to get something that looks as good as possible and captures the memory as well as possible without having to fuss over it. I'm still willing to edit the photo a bit if it didn't come out how I wanted it to, but most of the time it just gets posted without any changes. This is why I chose the pixel because 90% of the time it produces a stunning shot that looks great to post right away, and the 10% it doesn't I'm happy to go back and edit it until I'm happy. Very rarely does a shot simply not turn out at all -- an especially stark contrast to film photography.\n\nI view all of the computational advancements in smartphone photography as a very good thing for artists, because it opens up much more mental space for creativity with my other cameras. When I leave the house with my Mamiya or Lumix, I'm doing it because I intend to look for interesting moments, I'm aiming to create something not necessarily tied to the thing I am taking a picture of. My smartphone camera is not like that, it's something that's there when I need it, something I can quickly pull out and use to capture the time my cat fell in bowl of cranberry sauce, or make a quick video to send to my brother.\n\nI will say that these categories are not universally clear cut, there's certainly some crossover between them. Especially with the Pixel's powerful portrait mode, I occasionally find myself really fussing over a shot in the same way I would with my other cameras. Sometimes I'm looking back through my camera roll and I see a shot the makes me think \"Wow! I couldn't have done that on the Mamiya\". But that state of focus that largely divides the two formats in my mind is extremely important. It's one of the reasons why film photography is having a resurgence despite digital being technically superior in nearly every way. The device you use to take a picture impacts how much you think about the image you're taking, and that in turn affects what image you end up with. It's a mistake to say smartphones are making us worse photographers, they just make us different photographers.", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "@justin.booth.", "channel": "UCrGecswdVRXM6CXNJAKnzCQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AOPolaTje-1KwGuONmuIS-eqwUikMnPxt1dxpeycvIwykw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": false, "time_parsed": 1658612771.362148}

There will always be a disconnect between that and people who prefer that control and who are photographers.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "@KyleCulver", "channel": "UCK2pBkP29KfPKZbkzDYCuFw", "votes": "9", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AOPolaTbR9oqhCTkR5y5di4eL3zad1gONtPurvm2PvTIk3k=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": false, "time_parsed": 1658612773.771735}

What’s also disturbing is I’ve dealt with models and people that you see in social media, and then you meet in real life and I don’t know who they are, then they request that their images be edited to a certain degree and sliming the face, changing waistlines, bust sizes, removing absurd amounts of achene and blemishes to the degree that when I’m done editing I felt like I just created this person that doesn’t exist.

{"cid": "UgxRRUHXIzOfHo4ovQh4AaABAg", "text": "I'd like to bring the question here even further. \nI think we got a misconception of what \"the best photo\" is back when Photoshop made it onto the scene. \nThe \"best photo\" should not be the \"best looking photo\", so it's not matter of whose control is over tuning. The best photo, theoretically speaking, should be a 1:1 mapping of the current camera view, hence infinite pixels each one mapping to infinite geometrical points in reality. We kind of had this, with non-digital cameras, a part from lens distortion, shutter imperfections and so on. Go and check out your old family photos, they'll look particularly pleasant to your eyes, trust me.\nWhat we can have now, of course, is not infinite pixels. What we should aim for, though, what we shall call \"best photo\" is the one having the max number of pixels possible, minimizing the loss function of each pixel over color, shape, position wrt the corresponding region in reality. That is, the photo which resembles the actual scene the most.\nNote how this does not generally mean the best looking photo. Instead, this is most of the time false.

I actually think cameras that just gather light and record it are less true to life. I remember when I was first doing photography in high school on a K1000 and my photos never looked how I saw them. I realized at some point that higher dynamic range, pupil dilation, stitching in-focus and out-of-focus areas together, colour correction, etc. were all happening in your brain. It gets even weirder when you take temporal perception into account. I think one of human's biggest conceits is that we know what \"reality\" is. I think deep down we know this is a conceit and that's why we get so sensitive when our notion of reality is challenged. You might think of some scientific reality, where we are keeping a photon record within a certain frequency range, but photos will never display this very well. A photo and our viewing of it will always be a projection of some higher fidelity data source onto our subjective experience. Think of that blue/gold dress phenomenon. That was a photo.

Which got me to download a third party app, just to lock the telephoto lens.\n\nIn the end i think lots of AI software decisions make sense, but i believe there should always be a switch in the settings to turn them off or on… because: How can i say i own this iPhone, if i can‘t even switch the lenses whenever i want it?", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "@arachano89", "channel": "UCR6UEIk63Qvkcw8ESa1U8sQ", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AOPolaR1dQFlClQapOgW7UR0ec9LcbKfPFM7xRCurRPBpQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": false, "time_parsed": 1658612800.785313}

{"cid": "UgwYl41i5UWnUqoaU7B4AaABAg", "text": "Outside the legal complications, I feel like something important is being lost.  I regularly notice on social apps that some friends never post a 'real' photo of themselves anymore, it's quite genuinely to the point where I'm no longer sure of what they actually look like.  I'm of a different generation, but I've observed a steep and almost drastic change in the importance of appearance.  Be it from taking selfies in cool places, to transposing a fake view of your family's life onto a social media account, with carefully tailored video and photo.  Another thing I've noticed, which at first seems unrelated, is a change in attitude to alcohol in younger adults from when I was their age.  It initially felt like a good thing, not drinking as much is a positive, but it was the reasons for this change that concerned me. Again this is just my localized observation, but when I did some digging, one of the main reasons was fear of being recorded drunk, doing something embarrassing and having that permanently associated with them on social media for the rest of their lives.  This was a shock realization for me.  I did some pretty daft stuff both sober and drunk in my 20s, nothing illegal or malicious or that harmed others, but stuff that would embarrass me, put me in a negative light.   The thought that if I had done any of that today, it would stay with me forever was quite sobering (pun intended).  So all this image adjustment is part of this, what I feel is a primarily toxic culture.  But, I don't think the photography tech is the problem, sure it may undermine creative photography because people stop learning how to manipulate images manually, but it's more about the reason people are using these tools, too many of our kids are using them to conform to lie, to make their life and body look like what society says it should.  This cannot be healthy for us, and it concerns me.  I don't think censoring this tech is the answer (it's mostly cool stuff if used appropriately), rather tackling the social media problem, where many of these fake life images are created and pushed onto people.  Life is about moments, moments of perfection, moments of heartache, moments of laughter, for me that is what great photography is, capturing those moments as they happen, not artificially creating them in accordance with the trends of social media and society.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "@Pukenukem", "channel": "UCy9C2nPojRw2y8XD8R9rtuQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AOPolaTflPlWjeini_GCIjY7fIV_XZTv4A5tVrfMkQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": false, "time_parsed": 1658612800.785313}

Because, sorry to get \"political\", as we saw with the Kyle Rittenhouse trial, it opens the door for prosecutors/defense to question whether photo/video evidence taken via smartphone is accurate and thus admissible in court and that's really scary considering how much stuff comes to light solely because someone had a smartphone photo/video of an incident. I hope that if smartphones continue down this route they have some metadata in the photos to tell what was changed in the photo.

{"cid": "UgyhtLv7TgJJpf1TjEl4AaABAg", "text": "I think, looking at smartphones as an experienced wedding photographer, there are huge upsides and huge downsides to the additional processing going on under the hood. Lets say at a wedding, I'd shooting group shots. I'll shoot a lot because I can't trust people to actually look at the camera with their eyes open. If I'm lucky, maybe 1 in 5 photo's will be usable. With a phone that's selecting only frames with open eyes, that's obviously going to increase that hit to miss ratio. On the flip side, the overly aggressive focus that phones have on maximum dynamic range in all scenes (especially on the iphone!) is usually the giveaway that you're looking at a smartphone image. Generally, it's a look that beginner photographers go for, but over time, you'll generally learn that controlling that dynamic range is how you achieve depth in your photo's. I've been on trips where I've shot a whole set of landscape photos on my main body, and then a whole extra set in DNG from my phone (I have a xiomi mi note 10), and generally, the results are fairly comparable. Yes, the phone has noisier and softer images, but you quickly realise how big of an advantage it is to have real control over your photos.\n\nJust as an addition, I'm dead against that features that allow users to change their features. All it does is reinforce to people that they aren't good enough as they are.

And when I take a photo myself with my actual camera, some want to see the result and they go like \"aargh I'm so ugly\". And they do prefer the ones taken by the smartphone. The phones soften the skin, especially in low light, for starters. Not only because they look better/younger, but also because they look like everyone else on social media. Which is kinda ridiculous if you think about it. What's even more ridiculous, is the fact that people, real people at that very moment, you know, the people you talk to and have fun with, see their realistic version at that moment, not the AI-improved version. But apparently that's less important. How crazy is that. I'm thinking this will all only get worse in the future. I have feeling that people seeing their nateral self (even with full blown make-up), will be the new \"nude\", and the AI filtered, improved versions will be the new \"dressed\" in the minds of future generations.

It's something that I always repeat clearly during my meetings with couples. They have my portfolio, they see the samples I brought with me. They know what to expect. If for some reason, the client is unhappy, because they expected \"smartphone photos, but bigger\" or whatever, that's not on me.\nBut I have a feeling, people see both \"sources\" as two seperate things and in my case, they still appreciated the final output I delivered. But indeed, they do appreciate the wave of smartphone material during their wedding - although I had some couples who prefered nobody took photos or video, which I understand too.\n\nThe same thing happens when I do (or did, these days...) the occasional event or nightlife assignment. I have witnessed the clear shift from \"oh there's photographer, that's cool, let's just continue to have fun and he'll capture us having fun and we'll see the results in a couple of days\" to ... (from miles away) \"Oh a photographer. No he wants to take a photo when I'm not posing. Stop him. Let's ask him to take posed group shot from us, completely standing still and having our most trained smiles, while everone around us is dancing and having fun\". And then sometimes they want me to redo it with their phone. Because, obviously, I can only show them the un-edited version of my RAW file.

On one hand it's nice to pull out my wizard's slab-O-glass and be able to snap off some quick shots that will almost always look great. Being able to concentrate on just the composition alone is great and for me, messing around in manual mode on a phone that can do it is just meh. And one can't deny the production level quality of video that's been coming from smartphones for sometime now. But then when I look at some of the still shots and clearly see what the AI is doing I sometimes don't like it. It almost feels fundamentally wrong at times.\n\nThose AI shots may look really good but the edits sometimes just bug me because it's not what I would've done with standard photography. Like you said, you're subjecting that shot to someone else's opinion and vision, those who tuned the software. Conversely I have tried to take advantage of the AI once I get used to what a particular phone does and that's been fun and interesting.\n\nOverall, phone cameras these days are amazing. I still well remember that jank old stuff from 10-15 years ago which was nearly useless in my opinion. Okay for rough documentation maybe but not much else in my opinion.\n\nYou know what could be interesting? What if Google for example implemented the whole jpeg+raw thing [they sort of do now] and extended it in photos where you could compare the AI version to the raw version as hints to edits? Somewhat like how you can currently compare original AI processed shots to your edits.

Both of those reduce picture quality but Apple seems to think that nobody will notice that. And they’re right to think that. We as consumers are idiots, ignorant on photography.

{"cid": "UgyfMyBl7gOOdECpTcd4AaABAg", "text": "First and foremost: You're a BEAUTIFUL PERSON! (You! Yes, you! The person reading this!) And I want you to be comfortable in your own skin.\n\nI'm not okay with beauty filters and the idea of most of this virtualized removal or addition of things. I turn all these features off, and I would hate to see a future where there is no option to turn them off. I'm against the idea where every photo has to portray the perfect image. Life isn't perfect and we need to stop pretending it is and masquerading it on the internet. When did everyone become afraid to be who they are? Our imperfections make us unique, and that uniqueness is beautiful... and it saddens me that people really don't see this as the case anymore. There's nothing wrong with being you and showing who you are. Just be you! You're unique and beautiful just the way you are! I really feel like beauty filters are just a subtle form of digital body shaming. Not only do they skew your face in an image, but they also skew your own personal perception of yourself, and it's harmful to many people's self-worth and self-image. That said, filters can indeed be quite fun, and they do have their place in certain settings. However, I don't know exactly where that line in the sand should be drawn. There is a certain point where the photo you take no longer represents any form of reality, what happened, and what you experienced. If anything, I would like to see photo software and hardware get better at being able to represent real life colors, saturation, and light-levels, instead of the skewing of it. I would value those photos way more than the ones that have skewed it to make it look more \"BEAUTIFIED\". In fact, when I do rarely edit a photo, I am usually trying to bring that photo closer to the real thing. I edit the colors to be closer to what I actually see. This is way more valuable to me, because it is actually more representative of something that I experienced and was that I was compelled to take a photo of. I want to capture \"THAT PARTICULAR\" beauty that was compelling enough to take the photo of it in the first place. NOT do it an injustice by completing skewing it beyond what was experienced.\n\nThis is all of course just how I feel and is solely my opinion on the subject. I wholly understand and can accept other people's opinions on this subject of discussion.\n\nHowever, where exactly is that line in the sand? I thought about it as I was writing this, and I think that the line in the sand is, \"It has to be an option\". An option that you have control over and can turn on or off at your own discretion and pleasure. Also, the user should be made aware that the feature even exists! In my current phone, it automatically had \"beautify\" features turned on. Now, I get how this could make people feel good about themselves in photos, and that's okay. But, when I took a photo of myself, I instantly thought the camera was crap. Because I knew that I don't look like that at all. The thing that was upsetting to me personally about it was that you're not even made aware that the filter is on. It was on by default. Furthermore, no explanation for what is going on is even offered in my phone about this. You have to determine what is going on yourself and dig through the settings to turn off these filters that are being applied to your photos. I guess what I mean in summation, is that not everyone is going to be like a smartphone power user and dig through every setting in every app in their phone. So, this default on \"beauty\" mode without telling your user that it is on and offering no explanation feels rather, as I said previously, disingenuous.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "@figment_of_eidolon2591", "channel": "UCFPAH213QGZKT-pp1EF1emA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AOPolaTP4aym_Amncfd67eJCrA6Lk2zQh1c4dXVnKntIOg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": false, "time_parsed": 1658612815.687886}

{"cid": "Ugy1CcmrlWy62n8SY1x4AaABAg", "text": "I think this speaks to the classic misrepresentation of photos as honest or unbiased. If you accept that a photo, no matter how \"unedited\" it is, is always taken at a time with a perspective then automating all of these traditionally post processes is a no brainer. I also think we have already begun to have a healthier distrust of images and videos due to deep fakes. So in that context these photos seem both an obvious next step but also maybe less attractive. \nThe other way to look at is that there are two types of photos. One to document and one to capture. If everyone is laughing and having a great time but the one photo you snapped was in a hectic moment and people's faces look like they're melting, is that more accurate or honest than the photo where the faces were swapped for sharp smiling ones? Which one capture the moment accurately? But then think of all the costume designers and makeup artists of the world trying to document thing for continuity. They may require a special \"raw\" app that doesn't clean up blemishes or take the shine off faces. So the perfect complexion in this instance is a worse document. \nSo it's all fine. Just a new tool. Probably wedding photographers are the most at risk here. Their photos are most vulnerable to algorithmic thinking as well as the most expensive photos most people will buy in their life.

For example, merging multiple shots of a group of people to get one where everyone looks their best. You can do this manually by taking many more photos, but it's more convenient if the phone does it. Same with HDR, or erasing a stray object from a shot. Conveniences are ok.\n\nAutomatically superimposing the moon is not OK. It's impossible to get that picture with that device. Impossible is not ok.\n\nI'm not sure where I land on taking a selfie with the mona lisa where it looks like I'm the only one there. Technically, this is possible in real life. Maybe with an off-hours tour. On the other hand, there will more people with such selfies than is possible, so this is still grossly misrepresenting reality. So I guess even if it's possible that a person has such a photo, it's not OK if every person can have the same photo. This is similar to making a person look more beautiful. It's possible for a person to be nearly perfectly good looking, but if everyone looks like that in their photos, it just unrealistically raises expectations.\n\nIt really doesn't matter what we think though.

That's what's so fascinating about looking at historical photos. It shows you exactly what happened in that moment in time. A picture of your grandparents, when they were young, that's accurate and will always be, as long as you have that photo. You'll always know what they looked like.

Because, as someone who has both known a lot of photographers and have done some myself, isn't that exactly what we do in Lightroom anyway? We apply a mask to get rid of a blemish, or blur the background, or add a filter to adjust your photo you shot in a LOG picture profile accidentally to look more natural, or... better?\n\nFilm photography was around for years and we never really questioned it. But, in 2021, if you look at a photo taken 30 years ago, it looks like a relic from a time long past. Colors are faded, lines are blurry, etc. Why? We were okay with those compromises, because we could pick up a cool little camera from Circuit City and be happy that we can capture any sort of moments.\n\nNow it's gotten to the point where we are questioning things. Does X sensor emit more blue, or less blue? Does the Y sensor come out too sharp?\n\nI just believe that some of these things are a result of us learning more about how cameras function (especially in the digital realm) and attempting to make it as accurate as possible. Some colors being more vibrant could be down to simply the sensor in the camera, or the added brightness might be a result of the sensor being too dim. So developers write code to correct that.\n\nLittle things like swapping the open eyes of a kid posing for a picture 100ms earlier for the closed eyes when they blinked the second you pressed the trigger... it's so close in time that it's unnoticeable. To me, that's technology making lives better, instead of ruining a memory with a crappy photo.\n\nBut when things get changed unnaturally, without giving the user an option to change it, and without even telling the user it's a thing... that's where I think the line is crossed. Apple's face smoothing algorithm on their new cameras might just be a result of a crappy sensor being upscaled... but it's likely software-driven.

I'm not talking about beauty features.. like because wide-angle cameras now are common in phones it seems that the photos taken with smartphones, especially Samsung ones warp peoples bodies in a way similar to how a fish-eye lens warps the pictures it takes.\n\nI've seen pictures of everyone from thots on Instagram and just girls taking selfies to even like Tim Kennedy Mr. bad ass special forces guy be totally warped by the camera. At Christmas time my fiancee and her friend took pictures of themselves in these Christmas stripe stockings and it looks like their legs are 10 feet long and their bodies look super tiny.. And in the example of Tim Kennedy I've seen pictures of him where his head looks tiny and way too small for his body, and I've seen another friend of mine who does the classic hold the phone with both hands selfie and her arms look extremely long while her body and face are tiny.\n\nBut this was really super interesting and in some ways kind of the same thing a bit.. That whole thing where you can change every feature of your face is common in Asia.. I hate it. My fiancee takes pictures that don't even look like her. You can completely change your appearance and I think that's really not good for self-esteem when you feel like you don't look good unless you're changing the entirety of your face.\n\nI've seen guys use it too it all has the same look.

There has always been someone or something making “decisions.” I think a good question to ask is are those decisions intelligible to the user, and do they closely enough evoke the intent of the user. \n\nFor someone at Disneyland the answer is prolly “did I get the shot of my family or do I have to sit here and fiddle with my camera for another few minutes.” For a photojournalist, maybe they require an image that is transparent about “decisions” it made and does it reflect closely enough to reality to be of journalistic quality.

Big features of \"professional\" cameras like 14-bit Raw files or 11 stops of dynamic range don't necessarily make your photos look better, they just give you more control over the end result. \n\nIt's kind of interesting to think about even when 'pro' camera features come to a smartphone, they are more about producing easy and pleasing results than they are about professional levels of control.

Yes, pro photographers want the unprocessed RAW, but then they beat the hell out of it with editing and alterations. As they say, it's an artistic view of what they captured... I think at the end this only harms the industry itself. People get used to these over the top images and they loose trust to what was genuinely captured vs edited. Loosing trust, means you will assume by default pictures have been manipulated. Is that good or bad? Not sure, but personally I believe this does a disservice to photographers that go the extra mile to capture real-life moments, at the right time. That's the actual art, that takes skill to accomplish.\n\nI will start having a serious problem when altering computational photography starts creeping into the RAW files of actual cameras...

{"cid": "UgyWnt7muqkvVfliLPN4AaABAg", "text": "4:00 Not entirely right. The moon's eccentric (slightly elliptical) orbit causes it to appear differently all the time. It changes apparent size by roughly 10% over the course of its orbit. The angle of its visible face also changes slightly (if you take an identical shot every night over one lunation and animate it, it looks like the moon is rocking very slightly back and forth). On top of that, the Earth is large enough and the moon close enough that you see the moon from a different angle depending on what part of the planet you're on.\n\nWhile it's certainly possible to map the surface of the moon to a 3D model that could then account for your location and the moon's apparent size, angle, and phase, I doubt anyone at the phone companies would consider it a priority worth spending any time on. Especially since the moon is extremely easy to take a picture of -- if the system is programmed to recognize the moon, it can easily drop to a slower ISO and faster shutter speed and give you a good picture.\n\nI like what you're bringing up in this video, but at the same time I think you have enough photography/videography experience to know better than to suggest that there's ever such a thing as 100% honesty in photography.\n\nThe same exact photo can be taken with different settings and yield very different results even without any post-processing applied. Which one is the \"real\" one? I think it was Camber Motion that posted a video a few years ago about how dramatically an image is affected just by changing the focal length of the lens. Photographers make a lot of decisions in how to take a picture (many of those decisions become second nature based on experience and preference, so they happen very quickly and on the fly, but everything from which lens to use, what ISO, f-stop, etc., etc.).\n\nMy favorite aspect of photography is that very lie. It's all about making the viewer see what the photographer intends. And it can be just as well accomplished with a smart phone's processing, once you (as the photographer) get familiar with that phone's pictures and understand how to work it to give the results you want.\n\nAs for the typical non-photographer's use of a camera, I think they just want a \"good\" picture without worrying about settings. A picture where one person in the crowd is blinking or halfway into a sneeze is considered bad and unwanted, instead of just being an honest memory. If they recognize it at the time, they'll likely take the picture again and delete the \"bad\" one.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "@davidg5898", "channel": "UC9LUzUgxQkCzA9I7tvButyg", "votes": "16", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AOPolaSzTpWV9hKQgAq5J_JlORY45viTsIaXtE0GT7rdAQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": false, "time_parsed": 1658612830.913744}

But for general purpose use and the broadest consumer base - it's not as bad as it might sound.\nMost people think of photographs as capturing reality and truth. And from a journalistic and historic point of view it's accurate and there are the dangers where \"tampering\" with reality is a bad thing.\nBut in an everyday casual use case - photos are often mostly about capturing memories rather than super-accurate reality.\nAnd if people have additional tools to their disposal and aren't \"pros\" - but are able to capture an awesome photo of that moment and create a great memory of that - it will always be a better option than capturing a shaky, blurry, bad-lighting, closed-eyes situation picture that is true and accurate - but no one wants to rewatch it later ever again.\nBut the important thing is that the obvious AI stuff should always be optional - never mandatory. I want a phone where I can choose if I need that kind of assistance. Because sometimes you might want that \"bad picture\" on purpose.\nBut other than that. I like the smart phones a lot.\nI take most my pictures nowadays with my phone - whilst my to professional Full Frame DSLRs don't get much use anymore. \nEven on holidays I LOVE being able to create photos AND video of great quality without having to lug around kilos/pounds of camera gear. 🤷🏻‍♂️ It's insane how much the hardware evolved over just 20-30 years.\nJust two decades ago people had to pay expensive helicopters to shoot aerial footage.\nNowadays almost every youtube travel video has crazy aerial footage in crispest hollywood quality. 🤯🤯🤯", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "@willionaire77", "channel": "UCmSCKa-4v7P1JpkniUa9qtg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AOPolaQowuN9W-xTTUbC0tDR_BkSQaQx2eZ-e3t4_uop=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": false, "time_parsed": 1658612834.660681}

Maybe allowing distortion-correction for wide angle images would be okay. But that’s it. Give me a standard auto-white balance with the ability to change it, autofocus, auto-ISO, and auto exposure time, and maybe the ability to adjust those last three.  Why? Because let’s say I need to send my doctor a photo of my skin condition... what if I can’t turn Apple’s skin-smoothing algorithm off (you can’t). Do I have to go out and buy a $400 camera that is JUST a camera? I usually don’t like the “tell congress to regulate it” approach, but in this case I think it’s necessary. We use cell phone photos and videos to document things, and those become court evidence in murder trials. They are medical information for my doctor. They document the condition of your apartment when you move in so you can get your damn deposit back. If the skin-smoothing / noise-filtering algorithm starts erasing the blemishes from the wall, it could cost your deposit when you move out. I want this shit LEGISLATED. I don’t care about requiring USB-C on the iPhone. I want to be able to use the camera to capture actual images of what’s actually there. I’m dropping somewhere near a thousand dollars on a phone.
