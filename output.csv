Nice explanation how to use naive Bayes for SA 👍pl . Try to share use of different machine learning algorithms with more accuracy performance...,0.2,1
Very well explained! Thank you so much for this video! Can you please explain how did you reach the 1420 value in data transformation?,0.25,1
"Great video! I wanted to know if we can use other classification algorithms such as KNN/XG-boost/decision tree/random forest instead of naive bayes? I mean if I keep the code unchanged till the data cleaning part and then change the code according to the different classifier algorithms,  will it work? I am not very concerned about accuracy here, I just want to know if it will work or not...if it does, how much do I need to change in the code section if I use the other above mentioned algorithms? please help.",0.023749999999999993,1

"Hi thats a great leacture.
i have a query while building my own sentiment model I am having issue with how to deal with the such sentence ""cell resource not failed and cell got connected"" now this is somehow positive one but I got negative sentiment because it has some negative terms.

Here is the question / issue I am having.
When I run the exact code for this notebook in Juypter notebook, I get different accuracy.  I get around .433.  All the code, data is exactly the same.

"In such cases, model needs to be provided with more contextual information. To begin with, you can explore different length word n-gram for BoW representation discussed in the video. Moving toward more complex approaches, you can explore  RNNs and LSTMs.",0.13999999999999999,1
" @skillcate  Thanks but for sentiment it does not required any labelled data but for LSTM it requires the data to be labelled and that is what I do not have!
please suggest me.",0.25,1
"Hey Jerry, Good to hear you're implementing it on your side. Here's what you should do next:

- Check your dataset: Make sure your dataset is labeled correctly and has enough examples for each sentiment category. Having a balanced dataset with enough representative samples can improve the model's performance.

- Data preprocessing: Clean your text data by removing unnecessary symbols, punctuation, or special characters. Additionally, removing common words that don't carry much sentiment (known as stop words) can help focus on more meaningful words.

- Feature selection: Instead of using only the Bag of Words representation, try other techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe). These methods capture more contextual information and can enhance the model's understanding of the sentiment.

- Model selection: Experiment with different algorithms besides Naive Bayes, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) or Random Forest. Each algorithm has its own strengths and may perform better on different types of data.

- Hyperparameter tuning: Adjust the settings of your model, known as hyperparameters, to find the best combination for your dataset. Use techniques like cross-validation or grid search to systematically explore different parameter values and select the ones that give the best results.

- More training data: If possible, gather more labeled data for training your model. Having a larger dataset can provide more diverse examples and improve the model's ability to generalize.

- Learn from mistakes: Analyze the errors made by your model. Look for patterns or common mistakes it makes. This analysis can help you identify areas for improvement and guide your next steps.

Remember, achieving high accuracy can be challenging, especially for beginners. It's important to keep learning, experimenting, and iterating on your approach. Don't get discouraged by initial low accuracy, as it's a common part of the learning process.

Do write me back for further specific questions you may have. We may have a 1:1 call too if it's required.",0.1680668934240363,1

"Dear Nagaswapna, the 2 X2 matrix you see at 18:45 is called a confusion matrix. For computing accuracy, we use this mathematical formula: Accuracy = (True Positive + True Negative) / (True Positive + True Negative + False Positive + False Negative). So, essentially, in our case, Accuracy = (67+64)/(67+64+38+11) = ~72.7%.
