Here's what you should do next:\n\n- Check your dataset: Make sure your dataset is labeled correctly and has enough examples for each sentiment category. Having a balanced dataset with enough representative samples can improve the model's performance.\n\n- Data preprocessing: Clean your text data by removing unnecessary symbols, punctuation, or special characters. Additionally, removing common words that don't carry much sentiment (known as stop words) can help focus on more meaningful words.\n\n- Feature selection: Instead of using only the Bag of Words representation, try other techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe). These methods capture more contextual information and can enhance the model's understanding of the sentiment.\n\n- Model selection: Experiment with different algorithms besides Naive Bayes, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) or Random Forest. Each algorithm has its own strengths and may perform better on different types of data.\n\n- Hyperparameter tuning: Adjust the settings of your model, known as hyperparameters, to find the best combination for your dataset. Use techniques like cross-validation or grid search to systematically explore different parameter values and select the ones that give the best results.\n\n- More training data: If possible, gather more labeled data for training your model. Having a larger dataset can provide more diverse examples and improve the model's ability to generalize.\n\n- Learn from mistakes: Analyze the errors made by your model. Look for patterns or common mistakes it makes. This analysis can help you identify areas for improvement and guide your next steps.\n\nRemember, achieving high accuracy can be challenging, especially for beginners. It's important to keep learning, experimenting, and iterating on your approach. Don't get discouraged by initial low accuracy, as it's a common part of the learning process.\n\nDo write me back for further specific questions you may have. We may have a 1:1 call too if it's required.",
